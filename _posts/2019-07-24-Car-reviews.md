NISSAN’S been here before. whereas Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Audi may be launching their initial full-electric vehicles this year, the japanese complete achieved that very same effort seven years past.

Needless to mention, it’s learnt loads of lessons since 2012, and it’s this expertise that Nissan says puts it at the forefront of the electrification movement.

So, it goes while not voice communication that the new Leaf little hatch represents an enormous people step forward, however with rivals currently rising in droves, can or not it’s able to assert itself because the best there was, the most effective there’s and also the best there ever can be? scan on to search out out.

Drive impressions

Pardon the pun, however the second-generation Leaf is stunning to drive. And no, we tend to don’t mean it’s very unhealthy.

While most different EVs bludgeon you with their well-publicised ‘instant torque’, Leaf is simply plain sleek, that may be a sensible and a foul factor.

Of course, you’ve got 320Nm on faucet from the showtime – and 110kW shortly – however you ne’er feel flooded by it. during this sense, it nearly feels similar in delivery off the road to a similar little hatch with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine.

But naturally there square measure variations that can’t be reconciled for higher or worse, like Leaf’s passing artistry. Stomp on the accelerator whereas already on the move and it builds speed faster than you’ll realise. therein sense, it’s as AN eV.

However, providing Nissan expects Leaf house owners to seldom take their vehicle on the far side town limits (as indicated by our inner-suburbs drive route at the national media launch), they’ll be principally subject to its plain acceleration off the road.

Obviously, some house owners can like this, however the theatre that different EVs offer is simply lacking here. And yes, we’re even talking regarding examples that have similar outputs to Leaf.

For reference, Leaf sprints from standstill to 100km/h in seven.9 seconds, that whereas good within the grand theme of things, is regarding 2 seconds off the pace of a potent front-wheel-drive hot hatch – that, by the way, you may be obtain for similar cash. however a lot of on it later.

In the in the meantime, it’s time we tend to address the elephant within the room: golf range. Leaf’s 40kWh lithium-ion battery serves up 270km on a full charge, consistent with Europe’s WLTP combined cycle take a look at that’s aforementioned to be a lot of realistic than its NEDC antecedent.

Nissan reckons this quite enough to finish vary anxiety, with the common Australian solely travel 38km each day, however we’d wager some folks would really like to travel on a protracted country drive on the weekend, and therein case, this is often not the vehicle for them.

Having driven 2 totally different Leafs at the national media launch, it’s arduous to assess what proportion harm our 110km mixed drive route did to the battery, however our rough calculations left America on pace to be a minimum of 50km wanting Nissan’s claim.

Needless to mention, if you’re seriously inquisitive about the Leaf, don’t expect to travel too so much in ANy direction while not sitting around at a charging station for a minimum of an hour to induce the battery from flat to eighty per cent – and that’s if you’re lucky enough to bump into a 50kW DC fast-charger.

Domestically, a three-pin AC electric receptacle will fill a depleted battery among twenty four hours, whereas a sevenkW AC wallbox from Jet Charge will absolutely charge it in regarding 7.5 hours, that is ideal for nightlong charging.

Either way, once models like Hyundai’s Kona electrical offer 450km of real-world golf range, it’s straightforward to search out Leaf a step behind.

Thankfully, AN e+ version of the latter with similar vary via a 62kWh battery in addition as a 160kW/340Nm motor is probably going to move Down beneath in time. On paper, it sounds far more competitive.

That said, one in every of our favorite innovations that excites that is on the market on Leaf nowadays is e-Pedal. It permits the driving force to begin, accelerate, decelerate, stop and hold the vehicle by exploitation the proper pedal solely.

While similar systems are utilized before, Leaf’s version is that the best we’ve sampled nevertheless. whereas e-Pedal harnesses the regenerative braking system, it’s not super aggressive in its execution.

Sure, once lifting off the accelerator, the driving force is quickly reminded that e-Pedal is engaged as Leaf begins to perceptibly retard, however see you later as you modulate the pedal movements, it’s a cinch to drive simply and swimmingly.

In fact, e-Pedal are a few things that quickly feels traditional. Yes, you’ve got to tweak your driving behaviours, however it eventually feels terribly logical. Frankly, we tend to wouldn’t drive Leaf the other means. however if you are doing favor to disengage it, brake-pedal feel is amazingly natural.

As so much because the Leaf driving expertise is different involved, it’s predictably quiet within around city, though road noise is unquestionably a lot of noticeable once cruising on the highway.

Light steering is teamed with a fairly communicative chassis. Predictably, the latter keeps body appear check throughout arduous cornering because of the low centre of gravity afforded by the ground mounting of the battery.

Of note, Leaf offers up many grip due to its 215/50 R17 tyres that aren’t as skinny because the hoops on another EVs. The initial tidal wave of peak toque will in brief see traction broken, however the recovery is fast and corners at speed do very little to upset matters.

Leaf’s suspension set-up (MacPherson struts up front and a twist beam at the rear) produces a cushty ride on Australian roads, though we tend to haven’t had the possibility nevertheless to check it on lower-quality country roads. Around city, though, bumps and lumps square measure soaked up.

Our main issue, though, with the driving expertise is Leaf’s protective version of lane departure warning. it’s improbably sensitive, reacting to any move that sees the driving force nod off their line. And with feedback delivered each audibly and physically, it very grates.

That said, this feature forms a part of Leaf’s in depth suite of advanced driver-assist systems, all of that square measure enclosed as customary. In fact, Leaf is therefore extremely fixed, it even comes with heated rear seats! they’re seldom found on alittle hatch.

And honestly, you’d wish the Leaf to be well-specified, as a result of it prices $49,990 and on-road prices. a rich little hatch or a cheap full-electric vehicle? We’ll allow you to be the decide.

Treat it subjectively and whereas Leaf is kitted-out, its interior doesn’t feel anyplace close to as premium because it ought to. low-cost arduous plastics abound, with relief solely coming back from a small amount of leather-accented upholstery on the dashboard and door inserts.

The cabin will, however, bring one thing long overdue: a brand new pic system. Nissan has been insulating material behind during this regard for a few time, by the new set-up ushers in an exceedingly higher-resolution eight.0-inch touchscreen that with pride displays sharp new graphics… however it’s all a bit too acquainted.

Functionality remains restricted, as instead of adding new options, Nissan has simply created the prevailing ones look higher. however – and this is often an enormous however – Apple CarPlay and mechanical man automobile support is finally here. So, don’t worry regarding exploitation the in-built pic system, infix your smartphone!

As with any new model, Leaf isn’t while not its quirks, particularly the shortage of reach adjustment for the wheel, the presence of a foot-operated park brake, the unintuitive gear selector, the tiny rider footwell and also the absence of rear air vents.

Leaf is additionally not the foremost accommodating vehicle, with six-foot-plus rear passengers afforded no headroom, notwithstanding legroom behind our 184cm driving position is generous.

And there’s the rear storage compartment, that is compromised by a high load lip and devoured into by the nuclear physicist sound system’s subwoofer (and Leaf’s charging cable).

Needless to mention, Leaf may be a little bit of a collection and it definitely won’t be for everybody. If you’re when AN eV that feels ‘normal’ to drive, Leaf is that the best example of that nevertheless, however simply don’t expect an excessive amount of excitement reciprocally.
