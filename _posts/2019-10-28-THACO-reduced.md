In October, BMW X3 is being discounted at the dealer with the highest discount of VND 45 million. Meanwhile, X5 model is reduced more, up to 100 million. In addition, X3 car buyers at this time are also offered an additional 3-year maintenance package with a value of up to tens of million.

This is the first time the new X3 and X5 duo have been discounted since the launch of Vietnam market in July 2019. Previously, BMW has sharply reduced its old models with the highest reduction of nearly VND 300 million, but decided to keep the price of newly launched models (including X3, X5 and X7).

Specifically, after a fall, the prices of BMW X3 xDrive20i, X3 xDrive30i xLine and X3 xDrive30i M Sport also turn to VND 2,459 billion, VND 2,697 billion and VND 2,814 billion. The new price of BMW X5 xDrive40i xLine is VND 4,199 billion.

The new price of BMW X3 is still high compared to rival Mercedes-Benz GLC but the price of BMW X5 has been "much" softer than the price of Mercedes-Benz GLE. The new generation GLE model has just launched at VMS 2019 not long ago with the GLE 450 4Matic AMG version priced at VND 4,369 billion. Previously considered the most expensive X5 in the segment, this title has now ceded to GLE.

BMW X3 is distributed in Vietnam with 3 versions, 2 engines instead of just 1 version as the old generation. X3 2019 has a lot of changes from design to equipment. This model for the first time has a 12.3-inch digital screen clock, 10.3-inch entertainment screen, 16-speaker Harman Kardon audio, 3-zone automatic air conditioner, fragrance package with perfume high-end or auto parking system ... The new model size is bigger than before.

Although the X3 is higher than the GLC, the BMW model has more equipment. Moreover, X3 is also imported from Europe and GLC is a locally assembled vehicle.

The new generation BMW X5 has only 1 version. Changes on the new model include a larger size, a new design, a 12.3-inch digital screen clock, a 12.3-inch entertainment screen, and an independent 4-zone air conditioner. 7 seats in 5 + 2 format.
