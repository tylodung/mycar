A Toyota Land Cruiser owner who was quite willing to play when he just bought the car brought to the factory to replace the whole bodykit and new exhaust. The new car went to the sea and rolled on a mere 300 km.

This Land Cruiser's package is MTR. The bodykit was ordered from Russia. The name MTR is quite new in the Vietnamese market.

This bodykit makes the SUV more bunker with angled front bumper. The company adds two LED arrays on both sides, above the fog lights. The bumper also has additional air intakes to increase aerodynamics for the vehicle. New type grille. The rear end is also more muscular with large exhaust cavities and wind diffusers placed in the center. 4 exhaust pipes placed symmetrically on both sides enhance the surface of the Land Cruiser.

Vehicle owners only choose to replace the bodykit, not the rim. The rim is still of the original type. The engine is also not interfering, only the exhaust system helps to bring a more excited sound. V8 4.6-liter capacity for 304 horsepower and torque of 439 Nm, combined with automatic transmission.
