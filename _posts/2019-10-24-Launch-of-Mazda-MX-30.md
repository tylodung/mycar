From the outside, the Mazda MX-30 features a true sporty hybrid coupe SUV with large wheel arches, long bonnet and tapered roof.

As can be seen in the image, the rear door on the MX-30 is extremely special when it is both reversible and without the outside handle. The small size means it is harder for users to come in and out, but the inverted door interface neutralizes that factor.

Returning to the main focus that so many people care about the first Mazda electric car: the powertrain. So far, the company has not confirmed the MX-30 specification in Asia / Japan, but in Europe, the configuration used will be a single 143 hp electric motor with 35.5 kWh battery for range. "modest" in terms of current market standards: 210 km.

In return, Mazda confirmed that the driving experience of the MX-30 will be among the most satisfying in the global electric vehicle industry and create the necessary emotional connection between people and cars.

MX-30 cabin is made of eco-friendly materials such as wood on the center console from still-life trees and renewable, door panels made from recycled plastic or recycled seat covers. note.

The space layout creates a sense of airy, spacious with a small work from the columnless design B. Floating central control cluster supports control operations while the 7-inch central touch screen handles reconciliation, entertainment and auxiliary safety technology such as I-Activsense.

However, we can at least partly trust Mazda's promise of the above factors considering the MX-5 Miata is also considered as a top 1 cheap roadster village while having a modest capacity.
