After nearly 1 year on the market, Mitsubishi Xpander received the first summoning order in Vietnam for the first time. The problem comes from the pump in the fuel tank, which, according to the Japanese automaker, may have stopped working, resulting in the inability to start the engine or the engine to stop working.

The original cause of this phenomenon was determined by Mitsubishi Motors Japan (MMC) because the plastic impeller on the inside of the petrol pump could inflate and lead to the gasoline pump to stop spinning. The more detailed cause has not been completely determined but the results of the investigation show that the plastic impellers with low molecular densities will easily inflate.

According to the announcement, a total of 14,051 Xpander vehicles are in the recall area, including 9,428 units of the AT version produced from August 14, 2018 to August 22, 2019 and 4,623 units of the MT version with export time. workshop from August 23, 2018 to August 26, 2019.

All of the above vehicles have not been identified as causing any serious problems in Vietnam. After a thorough investigation, the Japanese automaker officially announced a recall and apologized for any inconvenience that would arise in the near future and expressed the desire to receive the cooperation of users to the error. Quick arising is repaired, resulting in more stable operation.

Along with that, Mitsubishi emphasizes that the Xpander sold from September 25, 2019 have been installed with a new petrol pump so that those who have received the new car can be assured of this technical error.

Recognizing the fault of the manufacturer, Mitsubishi Motors Vietnam (MMV) is conducting a free replacement of the new petrol pump for vehicles sold on the market. Time for each vehicle is about 72 minutes. In addition, customers who bring Xpander cars to replace the petrol pump according to the summoning campaign will receive a free oil change coupon, valid for 6 months.

This is considered a beautiful manners of a car company. Because any product shipped can get an error, especially a machine with thousands of details like cars. The problem that always lies in the manufacturer's way of repairing is caring or neglecting the user and improving the quality after each apology.

Accordingly, Xpander users in Vietnam can take their cars to authorized dealers nationwide to carry out inspections and replace petrol pumps. The summoning campaign lasts from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2021. To save time, customers should make an appointment with authorized dealers.
