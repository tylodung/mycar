Yikes. Volkswagen has broken the Goodwood hillclimb record, with the ID. R electric racer taking well over a second from Nick Heidfeld’s 20-year-old record in a McLaren Formula 1 car.

Romain Dumas and the ID. R, fresh from setting the electric car lap record at the Nürburgring, recorded a 41.18sec time up the driveway of Goodwood House on the first of the 2019 Festival of Speed’s timed runs on Friday, before smashing Heidfeld’s time properly on Saturday with a scintillating 39.90sec run, which you can see above.
