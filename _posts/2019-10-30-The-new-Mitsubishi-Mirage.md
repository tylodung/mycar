At the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, Autoindustriya had the opportunity to talk with veteran leader and designer of Mitsubishi Motors, Tsunehiro Kunimoto about new projects in the near future of the Japanese brand. One of the models they are quite interested in is Mirage and Mr. Kunimoto have a brief word about the urban vehicle is about to be born.

Specifically, he said the new generation Mirage will be especially different from what we see today, most importantly, the Dynamic Shield thermal design has started to be applied like Pajero Sport, Eclipse Cross or Xpander did.

This change will help Mirage head completely evolved with a more modern, more modern appearance. In addition, the body frame may also turn a bit more square (again like Xpander) to create a more harmonious overall with a new face.

The willingness to talk about the Mirage also shows that this urban model may be launched in the near future, as early as the first half of 2020. The size of the car is also reported to be a slight increase. from A segment to asymptotic segment B due to the new CMF-B chassis of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance (like Renault Clio or Nissan Micra).
