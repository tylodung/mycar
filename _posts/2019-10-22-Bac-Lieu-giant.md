The rich man from Bac Lieu decided to add to his collection of unique Lamborghini Aventador in Vietnam. It is known that in the garage of this giant there is another "super cow" Lamborghini Huracan of Vorsteiner Novara Edizione unique in Vietnam.

Not long after being bought by the rich Bac Lieu, "super cow" appeared at a famous super car showroom in District 5, Ho Chi Minh City. HCM, to be refurbished some details as well as put on gray decal layer. Originally, the car has a matte white paint with some contrasting details such as black wheels or red brake shackles.

This Lamborghini Aventador is essentially a normal LP700-4 version but has been upgraded to the bodykit of a limited edition called 50th Anniversario that was released in 2013 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the supercar brand.

The 50th Anniversario version changes drastically in the exterior. The front bumper of the car has been redesigned with the addition of two air vents on the sides to optimize aerodynamics. The rear bumper has also been refreshed to increase the engine's ability to escape heat. Bodykit package helps this car look almost identical to the genuine version.

The easy point to distinguish whether or not this is a true anniversary is that the seats are not embroidered with diamonds. On the 50th Anniversario version, it is standard equipment. Moreover, the vehicle's number plate in column A does not appear on this LP700-4.

Compared to the 50th Anniversario version, the Aventador LP700-4 has a capacity of less than 20 horsepower, at 700 horsepower while the other limited edition has a capacity of 720 horsepower. Maximum torque is the same at 690 Nm.
