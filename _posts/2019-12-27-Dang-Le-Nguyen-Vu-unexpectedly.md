After the series of sales of his supercars and luxury cars, Mr. Dang Le Nguyen Vu made the fans surprised when he bought the unique Mercedes-AMG SLS GT Final Edition in Vietnam.

This used to be the supercar associated with the name of Louis Nguyen, husband of the movie "jade lady" Tang Thanh Ha after being imported to Vietnam in late 2014. However, the number of appearances of this supercar on Vietnamese streets are not much.

Currently in Vietnam there are four Mercedes-AMG SLS, including two hardtop versions, a convertible version and the GT Final Edition mentioned in the article.

With the purchase of this supercar, Mr. Vu became the only Vietnamese to own the bird wing supercar line from the German three-pointed star brand with the number up to 4.

The Mercedes-AMG SLS GT Final Edition is a limited edition of the SLS AMG series, produced to mark the end of this series and only 350 units worldwide.

The price that Mr. Vu had to spend to buy this Mercedes-AMG SLS GT Final Edition from Ha Tang's husband's house was not disclosed. However, according to the car business, this super car costs about 14 billion, 2 billion more expensive than the standard version.
