Two women were seriously hurt Sunday when a tree fell and crushed their car on Washington Boulevard.

A Pittsburgh police officer was driving by when he saw the tree topple down from the hillside and onto the car just before 5 p.m. in the 1400 block of Washington Boulevard.

The two women, the driver and a passenger, were “heavily entrapped” inside. Two passengers in the back seat were able to get out and were not hurt.

Firefighters cut the tree off the car while paramedics cut the women out of the vehicle, according to police.

Both women were taken to the hospital.

The fallen tree blocked three lanes of traffic.

The road was cleared just before 6 p.m., according to police.
