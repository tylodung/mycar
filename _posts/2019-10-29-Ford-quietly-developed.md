Right from the development of the current generation GT, Ford knew early on that the output of this supercar will certainly be limited. Even if it has pledged to continue assembling its GT until 2022 (longer than expected by two years) in response to unusually high demand, it still needs to remember that this is a model that does not reach the masses.

As of January next year, the 2nd generation GT will turn 5 years old (debuting at the Detroit show 2015) and it seems the company is having a special project to welcome this milestone. According to The Drive, the Blue Oval brand will be quietly developing a new version for the 647-horsepower supercar based on racing technology applied by Le Mans.

Specifically, because GT has officially "retired" from the official tournament, Ford is free to customize the EcoBoost twin-turbocharged V6 engine the way it wants without being limited by the competition format. More significantly, this upgraded version will be modified to meet public operating standards instead of limited to the track and most importantly, outside the landmark of 1,501 vehicles expected by the US brand.

Considering that the new Shelby GT500 has hit the 760 horsepower threshold last year despite only using supercharged V8 engines, the number that GT specifically achieved can reach 800, 900 horsepower. Some of the changes that Ford can target are the cockpit, aerodynamic kit, high performance brakes and of course the price. The standard GT costs $ 450,000 / unit, the GT MkII nearly triples the above figure ($ 1.2 million) and the new version may need to reach the threshold of $ 1.5 million.
