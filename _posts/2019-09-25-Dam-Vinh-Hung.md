Dam Vinh Hung after many years of using the Lexus RX 350 decided to "break up". The reason for the car sold by this singer is because the car is in surplus. Mr. Dam also revealed that he owns up to 4 cars, so he has to sell the Lexus.

Lexus RX350 is the vehicle most attached to the image of Dam Vinh Hung in the past years. The luxury SUV is from 2011. This 7x singer likes white so every car is painted white, and so is the RX350.

In the used car market, a 2011 Lexus RX350 is priced from 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion depending on the situation. There are even ads that are super new at a price of approximately 2 billion. New purchase price is over 3 billion. This is one of the models holding prices in Vietnam.

A special feature on Mr. RX's 350 Dam is the license plate. The sea 012.12 is quite easy to remember. The singer said that "at this time, getting a good number plate and going forward like this is difficult".

The latest one added by Dam Vinh Hung to the collection is Toyota Alphard. The car was purchased in July 2019. The price of the car is not less than 4 billion dong, not counting the cost to the license plate. This MPV model is dubbed the "special aircraft ground" with luxurious furniture. Vehicles are imported by private enterprises. Even so, Toyota also distributes genuine Alphard.

Before that, this male singer also appeared with BMW X4 or Cadillac Escalade. In addition, the Toyota Sienna of Dam Vinh Hung is also being asked to buy back.
