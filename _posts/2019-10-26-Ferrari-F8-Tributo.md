On this morning (October 25), as scheduled, the Ferrari F8 Tributo was transported on specialized vehicles to exit Thailand.

After nearly two weeks of being imported to Vietnam to serve the opening of the first Ferrari showroom in Vietnam, this morning (October 25), as scheduled, the Ferrari F8 Tributo has been transported on specialized vehicles.

Earlier, on October 11, Ferrari F8 Tributo was opened at Cat Lai port, District 2, Ho Chi Minh City. This is also the first supercar brought to Vietnam by Ferrari in the form of genuine F1 racing car.

Reportedly, the next destination of the latest "super horse" of the Italian car company is Thailand - a fairly strong country in Ferrari in the region.

Accordingly, this car will be first launched with the Thai giants in November.

Thus, Thailand is the fourth country to appear this blockbuster, after Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.

Ferrari F8 Tributo is the successor to the Ferrari 488 GTB - the best-selling Ferrari supercar in Vietnam. Unlike the upgrade from Ferrari 458 Italia to Ferrari 488 GTB, the Ferrari F8 Tributo changes completely in design.

Ferrari F8 Tributo is known as the strongest mid-engine Ferrari supercar in history. The 3.9-liter twin-turbo V8 produces 720 hp and 770 Nm of torque.
