Saying Outlander is outdated compared to rivals at the present time is still a bit light. The 3rd generation has been on the market since 2014, two years ahead of the Renault-Nissan Alliance milestone and is now far behind its competitors in technology. The Japanese brand is aware of this and is preparing the first stages to introduce an entirely new version to the global market.

The first test version of Outlander has appeared in Europe in the past week. The camouflage layer hides a lot of details on the SUV, so there's temporarily nothing to say about the new generation design. However, we can use the Engelberg Tourer concept as well as some previously leaked information that we can rely on for reference.

First, the new Outlander chassis will be used in conjunction with the Nissan Rogue to save on development costs, which means that the size of the car will increase slightly compared to the current, helping to compete better with heavy medium-sized SUVs such as Mazda. CX-5 or Honda CR-V.

Next, the new Outlander engine can share the same Eclipse 1.5L 4-cylinder turbocharger. In the original engine for 153 horsepower capacity but on the Outlander will certainly be upgraded. Configuration of electric charging hybrid using a 2.4L engine will often have its own stage.

The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander will appear at one of the two major exhibitions early next year, Geneva (March) or New York (April).
