The Wheels Verdict: Exhuming the Genesis and giving it a modest refresh and rebadge doesn’t seem a formula for success, but there’s a small market niche – and small is all that Genesis needs right now – that will adore the formula of this relaxed and refined highway cruiser.WHAT IS THE GENESIS G80?

Let’s start at the beginning. Not with the Big Bang, but with an event shortly thereafter when Hyundai launched the Genesis sedan. That car arrived in Australia badged as the Hyundai Genesis in 2014, made a small ripple with private hire operators and then quietly disappeared a couple of years later. It’s recently been refreshed and Genesis is now the make, not the model. The engine is largely unchanged as is the car’s relaxed personality.

WHY WE’RE TESTING IT

The big drawcard of Genesis’ launch in Australia is the G70 sports sedan, but the company also had some G80s for us to drive so we decided to have a pedal in one to see whether this refreshed version has what it takes to rival cars like the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.GENESIS G80 REVIEW
A question has been vexing me lately. While we attempt to be meritocratic in the way we judge cars here at Wheels, it nevertheless remains the case that some cars – entirely independent of their objective attractions – are endearing and some just aren’t so much. Take this Genesis G80 for example. If pushed, it would be pretty easy to come up with a fairly lengthy list of its shortcomings yet to drive the thing (gently) is to love it. At the other extreme, you might well have a car like Volkswagen’s Golf R: objectively brilliant, but the recipient of respect rather than adoration.

So what is it that’s so charming about the Genesis G80, a car which is a strange sort of automotive zombie? Its progenitor appeared in 2014 as the Hyundai Genesis, a flagship model that sold to private hire operators looking for a cheap and reliable alternative to the premium German marques, but which quietly disappeared at some point last year. Now it’s back, renamed the Genesis G80 and it has been the beneficiary of a facelift.
