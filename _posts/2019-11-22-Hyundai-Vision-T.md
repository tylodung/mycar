The mid-size SUV concept uses a hybrid powertrain hybrid system combined with the latest generation of global design language Hyundai Sensuous Sportiness. A future version of a hybrid electric charger for Tucson is not out of reach for Hyundai, just whether they want it or not.

The design of the car uses a lot of details that have appeared on test versions of the Tucson 2021 such as the front of the car or the use of the hip floating lines. Of course, the complete version will not be so fierce but still promises to be a boldly desirable makeover of the mid-sized SUV. Dimensions of length x width x height are 4,610 x 1,938 x 1,704 mm, wheelbase 2,804 mm.


"We are always in search of innovative solutions in designing and adding new and exciting emotions based on the attractive Sport design language," said global design director and executive vice president Hyundai SangYup. Lee said. The side of the car is said to convey the message that is always strong going forward and the short nose but the long bonnet reflects "dynamic standing posture to face every challenge".


In addition to the sound from the new Tucson, Vision T features the Hidden Signature Lamp system similar to the Le Fil Rouge concept launched earlier. These lights are hidden behind a special mirror system with a chrome-like appearance that is both decorative when the light is off and the lighting cavity is activated.

The Parametric Air Shutter technology, meanwhile, simply understands dynamic cooling, optimizing the aerodynamics of the front of the car while creating a very emotional face for Vision T.
