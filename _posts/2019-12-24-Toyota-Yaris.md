Autocar newspaper was recently the first unit to test the high-performance version of Gazoo Racing of Toyota Yaris and they have exploited quite interesting information from the new hot hatch from the Japanese automaker.

Scheduled to officially debut at the Tokyo Auto Salon held in Japan in January, the Yaris GR is far different from the Yaris GRMN that Toyota had previously launched. The size and number of details are significantly more high-performance, most notably the new 3-door body instead of the 5 like the original Yaris launched in October.

Thanks to this change, the ceiling is pulled as low as possible (based on the operating standards that allow the car to be sold mass), thereby optimizing aerodynamics for both this and the rear spoiler. for the 2021 World Rally Championship season that Yaris GR attends.

Looking more broadly, almost the only Yaris GR chassis used is similar to the 4th generation just launched. The suspension is completely redesigned with the rear using a double wishbone structure linked with passive shock absorbers to reduce overall weight. The head and tail of the car are made wider, the wheel arches have grown to match the new large wheels and tires.

As previously announced, the Yaris GR uses 2-wheel drive with 3 torque split modes: 60:40, 30:70 and 50:50.

The Yaris GR engine used is also different from the GRMN. Instead of the British 1.8L turbocharged 4-cylinder, the all-new 1.6-liter turbocharged 3-cylinder engine with a capacity of no less than 250 hp and 350 Nm of torque. These parameters, according to the project's chief engineer, Naohiko Sato, are in the top 1 market if not counting Mercedes-AMG One super cars.

The Yaris GR is the first 100% Toyota-built sports car project without a partner in the last 20 years (86 and Supra both use the same technology as Subaru BRZ/BMW Z4).
